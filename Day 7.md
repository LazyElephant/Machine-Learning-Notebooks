# Thai Tokenizer

For day 7 of ML model practice, I deployed the Bidirectional RNN from day 6 to [heroku](https://thai-tokenizer.herokuapp.com/) using Flask and to [codepen](https://codepen.io/LazyElephant/full/KQXNXK/).  The server side code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/LazyElephant/Thai-Tokenizer)
